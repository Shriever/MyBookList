# MyBookList
An interactive book list made using OOP.

This gorgeous booklist was originally a project from Traversy Media. // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58
I adapted it so that the user does not need to input the author or the ISBN
and only needs to enter a semi-accurate title name.

I added this functionality using Google's Book API which provided
the properly formatted title, author name, ISBN, and page count, 
all of which are displayed to the user.

By creating this project, I gained valuable practice with OOP in Javascript 
as well as experience requesting data from an API. I also learned about localStorage
and how to use it to hold on to data even when the window is restarted or closed.
